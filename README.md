# INFSCI-2725
Data Analytic

In this project, the task is to develop an automated method to predict the cost of severity claims in Allstate with ensemble. Using ensemble to find the best model is our one of main goals. Meanwhile, another goal is working on data feature selection, and using the selected dataset to train the model for prediction. From the observation and analytic of this dataset, we used correlation and chi-square test to construct the feature dataset by removing redundant features. Ensemble prediction is a efficiency method to increase accuracy on the data set by combining the multiple models together. The project used 3 models (gbm, rpart, and xgbTree) as part of the ensemble model.
